Oneko is a little fun command that will change your regular cursor into a mouse and creates a curious little cat who will chase your cursor once you move it. It’s not limited to just the terminal. You can keep on working while the cat chases the cursor.
Install Oneko with this command:

sudo apt install oneko
Run it with this command:

oneko
In case you want a dog instead of a cat, type:

oneko -dog
There are a few more types of cats available. You can get that information by using oneko –help. To stop it, use Ctrl+C.
